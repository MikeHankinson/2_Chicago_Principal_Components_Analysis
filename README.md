# 2_Chicago_Principal_Components_Analysis

## Project: Principal Component Analysis
### Skills and Tools
1. Recognize the importance of dimension reduction and grasp how Principal Component Analysis achieves the goal of converting correlated variables to uncorrelated factors.
2. Thoroughly explore the results of Principal Component Analysis to establish connections with and draw inferences from the original dataset.
3. Utilize Latent Class Analysis to identify unlabeled target groups from categorical responses to survey data.

### Context
Having an inadequate sample size or a lack of explanatory variables are often hindrances to performing successful analyses. However, having access to an excessive amount of data can often be an issue as well. When examining data sets with a large number of variables, it can be difficult to uncover patterns within the data set and select a combination of predictors that will identify meaningful signals.

Use this PCA technique to reduce the number of variables needed for modeling.

### Problem Statement
Perform Principal Component Analysis to analyze the exercise performance variables in an athlete dataset.
    * Produce a correlation matrix of the variables.
    * Perform PCA and analyze the VAF by each factor. Include an elbow plot.
    * Interpret the first loading using loadings plot.
    * Use a bi plot of the first two factors and loadings and/or other visualizations to identify unique individuals.
